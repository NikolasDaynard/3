#Handmade

A language, hand compiled

Are you sick of the compiler misinterpreting what you meant? look no farther, this, fully turing complete eso-lang is just the answer.

It also allows the embedding of lua code, so no mucking about with handmade if there's no need!

To get started run
```
lua main.lua [script name]
```
and then compile it

Then it'll run, you can also copy the bytecode, put it in a .byte file and run that, to skip compilation

Made with love
